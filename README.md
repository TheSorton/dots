# dots
Welcome to my dots. 
Here you'll find a base16 theme I made (name still pending), along with my configuration files for the programs I use. 

You may also use the yml file provided to use generate more configs with [base16-builder](https://github.com/base16-builder/base16-builder)

# Fonts
I use a custom variation of Iosevka to make it more wide. 
```toml

[buildPlans.iosevka-custom.widths.normal]
shape = 525        # Unit Width, measured in 1/1000 em.
menu  = 5          # Width grade for the font's names.
css   = "normal"   # "font-stretch' property of webfont CSS.

```

# Issues
There are still some issues (namely coc.vim) and potentially other broken backgrounds and foregrounds. 

Will fix these if I get around to it.
